# ReactReduxProject

We will build simple service to create and view posts.
API ( https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ )

# Git flow:
1) You create branch only from master branch with name: <feature>-<description> eg. postList-list-posts-on-homepage
2) You commit code into you branch
3) When you are ready to deliver feature ( which means it's complitelly done ) you create PR to master branch
  and assign other developer to check it.
4) After check you can merge PR to master with squash ( which squash all your commits into 1 )

# Definition of done:

Done means:
* feature is working as expected
* feature do not break any existing code
* feature have all required parts like styling etc.

# Project should:

1) Be built using webpack ( I would prefer if you set him by yourself )
2) You can't use jquery
3) You cant use any style framework ( bootstrap etc are forbiden , do all styling by yourself )

# GOAL 
As in every normal project, goal can change so be prepared ;)

* Nice looking project 
* Ability to see list of posts :thumbsup:
* Ability to see single post :thumbsup:
* Ability to create new post
* Navigation :thumbsup:

# HINTS
I would suggest to use react-router as routing is essentail in every big react-redux project's.

You should work togeather as a team. Plan and split tasks between each other or try to use extreme programming ( pair programming style ), but it's up t you.

As in every project , you should use trello in which you should be added to control current project situation.
It's up to you to prepare project, divide functionality into tasks which you can resolve.
Each day I would ask you to post our report to slack so to know where we are. ( this will emulate Scrum)
