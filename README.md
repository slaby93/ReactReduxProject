# ReactReduxProject

We will build simple service to create and view posts.
API ( https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ )

# Project should:

1) Be built using webpack ( I would prefer if you set him by yourself )
2) You can't use jquery
3) You cant use any style framework ( bootstrap etc are forbiden , do all styling by yourself )

# GOAL

Whole goal is to crate NICE LOOKING service where we will request external data about posts and provide our users ability to
simple view existing posts ( so there should be a list of them ), we should be able to go into post by clicking on post title and see it body.

# HINTS
I would suggest to use react-router (https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy) as routing is essentail in every big react-redux project's.

You should work togeather as a team. Plan and split tasks between each other or try to use extreme programming ( pair programming style ), but it's up t you.

As in every project , you should use trello in which you should be added to control current project situation.
Each day I would ask you to post our report to slack so to know where we are. ( this will emulate SCRUM and AGIALE [<- read about them>])
